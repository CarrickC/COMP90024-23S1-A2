## Ansible Playbook Overview

### Intorduction

\item Establish four new instances, each with the appropriate selection of storage volume and security groups.
\item Mounting and conÔ¨Åguration of storage volumes on the relative instances.
\item Clone the necessary script files from GitHub, such as Dockerfiles and YAML files.
\item Install required dependencies and software packages, including but not limited to pip and Docker.
\item Deploy and configure CouchDB within Docker on instances 2, 3, and 4, designating instance 4 as the master node, and integrate the remaining instances into the CouchDB cluster.
\item Deploy the Mastodon harvest within Docker on instance 4.
\item Deploy data analytics scripts (for example, sentiment analysis) and the backend infrastructure within Docker on instance 1.
\item Implement Docker Swarm, designating instance 1 as the manager and instances 2, 3, and 4 as workers. Utilize Docker Swarm to create a frontend service.
